# Fine-Tune-Bert-For-Text-Classification

# Description
This project includes a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to fine-tune BERT for text classification using TensorFlow.

# Installation
To run the notebook, you will need Python and several dependencies, primarily TensorFlow and the BERT model. The steps below outline the process:
git clone lawrenceemenike
cd Fine-Tune-Bert-For-Text-Classification

# Usage
To use the notebook:

Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment: jupyter notebook Fine_Tune_BERT_for_Text_Classification_with_TensorFlow.ipynb
Run the cells in order to see how the BERT model is fine-tuned for text classification.

The notebook includes detailed comments explaining each step of the process, from data preparation to model training and evaluation.
